<p>Growing up as a mixed child in south Africa both during apartheid and after apartheid was no say ,born of a south African Xhosa mother and a Swiss –German father interracial relationship were illegal the time and thus “born a crime”; it all started when a young lady Patricia was in her early twenties , very determined made up her mind to move to an apartment in Johannesburg to and begin to work as a secretary, she meets up with Robert and they become friends before long they had started going out frequently hence realized that they loved each other despite their color and the racial segregation taking place where a black man was not supposed to associate with a white man, strict laws were implemented and the police enforced duties by using spies in different places to make sure that there would be no relationship between the blacks and the white. After becoming choosy Patricia asks Robert for a child. Because she wanted to establish a family of her own. Of course he declined the proposal because he didn’t want to be imprisoned. Just give me the child and you will not have to be responsible for it I will take care of it. Nothing more than that and he agreed later to that. Feb, 20th, 1984 Trevor a light-skinned mixed –race child is born.at this 
time it was illegal in south Africa for people to have sex with individuals from different racial classifications, Trevor is literally evidence of her criminal activity.</p>

<p> Noah talks about education through his first school at Maryville Academy, a private catholic school attended by different races. And mingled freely, blacks and white children. Noah transfers to another public school where his testing performance shows he should attend gifted classes, he is astonished to find almost exclusively these classes are for white students and then he realizes that black students attend classes with less academically advanced students he decided to switch to a black classes despite warning from school officials because he feels more welcome and experiences a sense of belonging with the black people. 
South African government wanted to limit education for blacks so they set up a system of Bantu schools where blacks were taught only rudimentary skills designated appropriate for the low – skilled jobs they were expected to hold. He also talks about his mother’s personal history Patricia’s parents divorced when she was young and she grew up unhappy with her mother and Sibling’s. She made a plan to go and live with her father, but she was unexpectedly sent to live with her aunt in isolated farm area. Growing up there Patricia experienced intense poverty but received a good education at a local mission school.</p>

<p>Despite growing up with a lot of challenges and restrictions, Noah has gone on to be credibly successful, some of that can be can be attributed to his linguistic fluidity, education and sense of confidence.as a mixed race individual, Noah is at a disadvantage because he does not belong clearly to any one group.one strategy he adopts to cope with this lack of fixed identity is enhancing his ability to move between as many groups as possible he could fit anywhere and everywhere by learning speak multiple languages helearns this from his mother patricia

                                 <h5>RELIGION</h5>

<p>Christianity was introduced by European colonialist due to Christianity Patricia ‘s faith was so strong in sense that it boosted her confidence bravery that actually makes it possible for her rebel against those oppressive system. Noah’s grandmother believed that Noah’s prayers were powerful and that god would answer his prayers so fast since the background of religion came from whites so Noah would pray for people and other hand his mother would attend three services on Sunday from different places example black church, white church, mixed church which used to be of a mixed race for Jesus is for us all.  After  a long day of attending church services,Noah’s mother and her two sons find themselves  far from home within transit available after getting into  another minibus he was so angry at be deprived of  his fare after we a jesus </p>
